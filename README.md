Part of my Wroc≈Çaw University of Science and Technology engineering thesis. The work focuses on a prototype system for collecting and analysing vehicle sales data.  
## Abstract
  The work focuses on the design and implementation of a prototype system for analyzing
data from vehicle sales advertisements obtained from selected online platforms. The primary
goal of the system is to automate the processes of collecting, analyzing, and visualizing
advertisement data. Additionally, the system has been enhanced with a feature for enriching
structured data using natural language processing (NLP) techniques. The system was designed
with a modular architecture that includes data extraction and analysis modules, a database, and
an interactive visualization interface. The study includes an analysis of existing solutions, such
as Otomoto, Omnipret, and Carfax, highlighting their limitations and areas for improvement.
Based on the conducted analyses, a system was designed and a prototype implemented,
enabling the analysis of vehicle sales history, an overview of car prices, and an examination of
general automotive market characteristics. The implementation utilized technologies such as
Python, Selenium, OpenAI, and Power BI, which enabled the creation of a prototype capable
of efficiently processing large datasets and generating detailed reports for various user groups.
The proposed solution provides users with advanced tools for easily analyzing the automotive
market, including aspects such as vehicle pricing, sales history, and overall market trends. The
work also identifies the potential for further development of the system, including full
deployment in a cloud environment and integration with additional data sources. The analysis
and implementation also pave the way for the development of a commercialized system of this
type.
